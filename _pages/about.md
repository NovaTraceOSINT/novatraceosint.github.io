Hey — I’m Romer, the OSINT investigator behind **NovaTrace**.

By day, I work as a biomedical equipment technician, but my curiosity about digital threats and scams led me deep into the world of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**. What started as a personal interest evolved into real investigations — tracing scam networks, analyzing phishing attempts, and documenting how social engineering campaigns unfold.

I created **NovaTrace OSINT** to:
- Share my investigative findings
- Help others recognize emerging scam tactics
- Showcase the skills I’ve developed in digital forensics, metadata analysis, and threat research

I’ve completed the **Practical OSINT Research Professional (PORP)** certification from TCM Security and I’m currently expanding into malware analysis and threat intelligence.

This blog is part story, part case file — a place where I document real-world scams I’ve investigated and the tools I use to trace them.

### Skills I Use

- Reverse Image Search (and facial similarity tracing)
- Domain investigation and DNS analysis
- Metadata and email header analysis
- WHOIS and IP tracing
- Chat log and social network mapping
- Sock puppet and passive reconnaissance techniques

### Why NovaTrace?

“Nova” because it represents light in the dark. “Trace” because that’s what OSINT is: following the trail.
