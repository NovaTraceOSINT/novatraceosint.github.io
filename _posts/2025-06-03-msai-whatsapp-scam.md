title: "MSAI WhatsApp Scam Investigation"
date: 2025-06-03

I conducted an OSINT investigation on a fake WhatsApp group impersonating Morgan Stanley. This group promoted a fake "MSAI Training Center" led by a fabricated version of Jed Finn ("Jade Finn").

## Key Findings

- The same invoice scam template has been reused across Instagram and other platforms.
- Several phone numbers linked to the group are known scam lines.
- Domain impersonation and LinkedIn social engineering were used to build false credibility.

Stay tuned for the full write-up. This case is ongoing, and Iâ€™ll be documenting new techniques and trace methods as they develop.
